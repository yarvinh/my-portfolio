                  I'm an experienced Low Voltage Technician with a passion for technology and problem-solving, transitioning into a Full Stack Developer role.
                  As a technician, I have experience in troubleshooting complex systems. 
                  Additionally, I have the ability to analyze new and unfamiliar systems, learning how they function to perform necessary maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have established a solid foundation in Ruby, React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but Iâ€™m open to working with various other technologies.
